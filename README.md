This library allows you to control a Notecard by coding in Python and works in
a desktop setting, on Single-Board Computers like the Raspberry Pi, and on
Microcontrollers with MicroPython or CircuitPython support.

## Installation

With `pip` via PyPi:

```bash
pip install note-python
```

or


```bash
pip3 install note-python
```

For use with MicroPython or CircuitPython, copy the contents of the `notecard`
directory into the `lib` directory of your device.

## Usage

```python
import notecard
```

The `note-python` library requires a pointer to a serial or i2c object that you
initialize and pass into the library. This object differs based on platform, so
consult the [examples](examples/) directory for platform-specific guidance.

### Serial Configuration


#### Linux and Raspberry Pi
```python
# Use PySerial on a Linux desktop or Raspberry Pi
import serial
port = serial.Serial("/dev/serial0", 9600)

card = notecard.OpenSerial(port)
```

#### macOS and Windows

```python
# Use PySerial on a desktop
import serial
#macOS
port = serial.Serial(port="/dev/tty.usbmodemNOTE1",
                     baudrate=9600)
# Windows
# port = serial.Serial(port="COM4",
#                     baudrate=9600)

card = notecard.OpenSerial(port)
```


### I2C Configuration

```python
# Use python-periphery on a Linux desktop or Raspberry Pi
from periphery import I2C
port = I2C("/dev/i2c-1")

card = notecard.OpenI2C(port, 0, 0)
```

### Sending Notecard Requests

Whether using Serial or I2C, sending Notecard requests and reading responses
follows the same pattern:

1. Create a JSON object that adheres to the Notecard API.
2. Call `Transaction` on a `Notecard` object and pass in the request JSON
object.
3. Make sure the response contains the data you need

```python
# Construct a JSON Object to add a Note to the Notecard
req = {"req": "note.add"}
req["body"] = {"temp": 18.6}

rsp = card.Transaction(req)
print(rsp) # {"total":1}
```

### Using the Library Fluent API

The `notecard` class allows complete access to the Notecard API via manual JSON
object construction and the `Transaction` method. Alternatively, you can import
one or more Fluent API helpers to work with common aspects of the Notecard API
without having to author JSON objects, by hand. **Note** that not all aspects of
the Notecard API are available using these helpers. For a complete list of
supported helpers, visit the [API](API.md) doc.

Here's an example that uses the `hub` helper to set the Notecard Product UID
in CircuitPython:

```python
import board
import busio

import notecard
from notecard import card, hub, note

port = busio.I2C(board.SCL, board.SDA)
nCard = notecard.OpenI2C(port, 0, 0, debug=True)

productUID = "com.blues.brandon.tester"
rsp = hub.set(nCard, productUID, mode="continuous", sync=True)

print(rsp) # {}
```

## Examples

The [examples](examples/) directory contains examples for using this
library with:

- [Serial](examples/notecard-basics/serial_example.py)
- [I2C](examples/notecard-basics/i2c_example.py)
- [RaspberryPi](examples/notecard-basics/rpi_example.py)
- [CircuitPython](examples/notecard-basics/cpy_example.py)
- [MicroPython](examples/notecard-basics/mpy_example.py)

## Contributing

We love issues, fixes, and pull requests from everyone. By participating in
this project, you agree to abide by the Blues Inc [code of conduct].

For details on contributions we accept and the process for contributing, see
our [contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Running the Tests

If you're planning to contribute to this repo, please be sure to run the tests
before submitting a PR. First run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, run the linter and tests using the included `Makefile`.

```bash
make
```

Alternatively, you can inspect the contents of the [Makefile](Makefile) and run
`flake8` and `pytest` directly. Be aware, however, that the commands in the
`Makefile` run against every pull request, so your best bet is to ensure these
tests are successful before submitting your PR.

## Installing the `pre-commit` Hook

Please run

`pre-commit install`

Before committing to this repo. It will catch a lot of common errors that you can fix locally.

You may also run the pre-commit checks before committing with

`pre-commit run`

Note that `pre-commit run` only considers staged changes, so be sure all
changes are staged before running this.
