## Submitting an Issue

* We use the [GitHub issue tracker][issues] to track bugs and features.
* Before submitting a bug report or feature request, check to make sure it
  hasn't
  already been submitted.
* When submitting a bug report, please include a [Gist][] that includes a stack
  trace and any details that may be necessary to reproduce the bug, including
  your release version, python version, and operating system.  Ideally, a bug report
  should include a pull request with failing specs.

* Issues will be closed once they're assumed to be fixed or answered. If the
  maintainer is wrong, it can be opened again.

  We will happily reopen the issue.
